## Motivation

I created this because I couldn't find a discord bot that really fitted my needs as an individual running a mid sized server  
Also, I have been learning c# so this was a good place to expand my learning and knowledge  

## Installation

Run in visual studio or build using msbuild command   
On startup you will be asked to input a bot token and a prefix  
these will be written to a config file
